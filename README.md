## üîë Important Information

Potentially it can work on that laptops:

- Thinkpad A485
- Thinkpad X395 (not sure, better see [That project](https://github.com/adam-ht/Lentosh))
- Thinkpad E485
- Thinkpad E585
- IdeaPad 330-15ARR
- IdeaPad 720S-13ARR
- Yoga 530-14ARR

**BUT** it'll require USB remapping **AND** generating ACPI tables.
I've used this guides:
