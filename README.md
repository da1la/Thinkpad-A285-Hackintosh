## üîë Important Information

Please note that individual results may vary. The configurations and performance can differ based on your hardware and software environments. Specifically, I have not replaced my trackpad with a glass replacement, which may not be the case for your setup. This could lead to differences in trackpad issues and performance. Use this guide as a starting point and tailor the solutions to fit your specific needs.
